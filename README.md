# mantine-resource-scheduler

A simple but customizable resource scheduler/timeline built with mantine

It uses the following peer dependencies:

- `@mantine/hooks`
- `@mantine/core`
- `dayjs`
- `@use-gesture/react`

Roadmap:

- Selectable fields for creating new Entries fast
- Correctly working gesture control with use-gesture
- More examples and minimal documentation in Storybook
- Tests, tests, tests
